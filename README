Note: need to run both front end and backend, to run front end, go to the frontend directory and then start

// backend

// TO RUN
nodemon index.js

// or 
npm start

// Some notes:

Model design:

One to many relations between each tech section and guru links.

One to many relations between each user and messages.


To have launchd start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community now and restart at login:
  brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf

TODO:

1. Fix the routing issue, after the user logs in, it should go back to the previous page.
   (history.goBack has a problem right now. scenario: user clicks Sign Up first, then Sign In) 

2. Complete the seed.js file, export data from mongo, close db

3. Style tech sections and todos pages for the admin login
